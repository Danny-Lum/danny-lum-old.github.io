					<h3>Rationale</h3>
					<p>For this project, I decided to use the song Carry On by FUN. The song talks about how no matter
						how bad or down you’re feeling you can always move past that and move forward and carry on. The
						song is very motivational where it tries to lift your spirits up after being brought down, and
						so I decided to focus my design on that aspect of the song. I designed the overall layout to
						start from the top going down and eventually going back up. I think it captures the message of
						the song of getting back up after being knocked down.</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Font</h3>
						The letters I used were Selfish as the base and Fresh Mint to combine; Selfish is more of a
						traditional cursive font with a small detail on the strokes whereas <br />Fresh Mint has
						multiple lines forming the strokes of the letter. For the lyrics, I went with a wavey flow where
						the text curved down and curved back up on <br />the next spread. The flow was to help express
						the message of the song more clearly by showing how not matter low you go in life you can always
						carry on and work your way back up.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3>Image</h3>
						My original idea was to have the image of someone walking to represent the movement. I later
						added more images to represent the actual movement but that decrease the space to put my text. I
						later changed to the idea of using footprints instead and going in multiple directions but
						eventually leading to 1 going upward direction to represent the message of going back up from
						being down. There are small details of wind trails within the text to represent wind, I thought
						that it would add to the message of the movement. The color is a lighter shade of the background
						and I lower the opacity so it’s subtle enough to see but not distracting.
